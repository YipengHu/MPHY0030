## 1. Development environment 
There is no requirement, in tutorials or assessed coursework, for what the development environment or tools that need to be used. However, technical support from this module is available for the setups detailed in the following documents, under `docs` folder.
- [Supported development environment for Python](./docs/dev_env_python.md)

### Python environment
The tutorials require a few dependencies, numpy, scipy, matplotlib. Individual tutorials may also require other libraries which will be specified in the readme.md in individual tutorial folders (see links below).

Miniconda or Anaconda is recommended to set up the Python development environment.
```bash
conda create --name mphy0030 numpy scipy matplotlib 
```

## 2. Python refresher course
This mini-course has two parts, Python programming and scientific computing, by Shaheer Saeed. Materials can also be found in the [`tutorials`](./tutorials/) folder.


## 3. Tutorials
These are the tutorials under the [`tutorials`](./tutorials/) folder using Python, with optionally assessed questions.

>MATLAB is a proprietary multi-paradigm programming language and numerical computing environment developed by MathWorks. Some tutorials are also additionally with MATLAB code for those who have relevant experience.
