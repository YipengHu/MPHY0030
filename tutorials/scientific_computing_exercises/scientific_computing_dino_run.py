# Task 1:
# !pip install pyautogui


# Task 2:

# !mkdir dino-run
# !cd dino-run
# !git clone https://github.com/s-sd/Chrome-Dino-Runner.git
# !ls
# !cd Chrome-Dino-Runner
# !pip install -r requirements.txt 
# (error if you follow the online instructions because missing -r)

# !python3 chromedino.py 
# should return an error related to score.txt
# create a file called score.txt and add a zero inside it (manusally or in
# your script)
# the author used their own score.txt
# ls

# if you created a file but left it empty
# python3 chromedino.py (opens but closes when you press a key)
# max arg is an empty sequence error is shown
# check trace  and find that score_ints is empty
# what is score_ints?
# search chromedino.py and find that score_ints is from score.txt
# populate score.txt with some dummy values (add a zero is okay)

# if unable to access it, https://chromedino.com/

# if creating a venv:
# python3 -m venv dino
# chmod +x dino/bin/activate
