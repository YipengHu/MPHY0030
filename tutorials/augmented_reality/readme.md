# Augmented reality 


## Python
Additional library SimpleITK and scikit-image are required in addition to those set up in the `mphy0030` environment.
```bash
pip install simpleitk scikit-image numpy-stl
```

Then you can run the script.
```bash 
python script_ar.py  
```

Then use any medical image viewer to load the image and the surface model data. The 3D slicer displays it as below.
