# Iterative closest point 
This is a point registration algorithm, estimating a rigid transformation between two point clouds. It is used as an example of feature-based image registration, when the point clouds are extracted from medical images.


## Python
```bash 
python script_icp.py  
```

You should then be able to align two point clouds representing prostate glands.
