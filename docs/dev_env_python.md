# Supported development environment for Python

## Operating system
- Linux is supported, e.g. Ubuntu, Debian and their variants.
- Windows is supported with [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Follow the link to install WSL, and to get an Linux Terminal (if unsure, choose any version of Ubuntu). You can access your Windows files at `/mnt`, often `/mnt/c`.

>**Note:** Developing Python natively on Windows, e.g. using [Microsoft Store app Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/beginners) or [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html), is possible and preferable by some. However, technical support will not be available from this module. 

- Chrome OS is supported with its [Linux turned on](https://chromeos.dev/en/linux/setup).
- MacOS is experimentally supported. Please get in touch with the tutors if you need assistance setting up the development environment on your Mac.


## Virtual environment
For tutorials and coursework, external libraries and packages will be useful. There are many ways to manage your development environment. This module supports the use of `venv` and `pip`.



## Install Visual Studio Code
There are also many IDEs or code editors supporting Python. Technical support is available for Visual Studio Code.  
- Install [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs).  
>**Note:** For working on WSL on Windows, you may need to add [remote development extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl).

- Add the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). This can be done in the VSC Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X).

For example, you can find a step-by-step [tutorial in the VSC documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).


## Tutorials
To get started with Python, it is recommended to go through at least one of the following options, for what is needed in this module.
- Chapters 0 - 7 in [Dive into Python 3](https://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/)

- Sections 1 - 10 in [Documentation on the python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

- The "Python Basic Tutorial" in [On tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm)
